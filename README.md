<h3 align="left"> About Me</h3>

-  A strong foundation in Networking and Security. I currently have CompTIA Security Plus and CCNA certifications.
-  Iâ€™m looking to learn more about the cloud. I am currently building a (mini) SOC & Honeynet in Azure (w/ Live Traffic).
-  AWS Virtual Private Clouds are what I want to gain deep extensive knowledge and experience in over the next year. 
-  Let's talk about security, networking, my recent projects and even my journey into this space!
-  One thing I've loved so far about Kali Linux is that there's almost always a solution for every problem. Challenging, but one of my favorites so far.
-  I would especially like to work on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. Let's chat!
